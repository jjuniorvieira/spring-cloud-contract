- Producer – Server Side

We’re going to write a producer side CDC, in the form of an EvenOddController


- Consumer – Client Side 

The consumer side of our CDC will consume stubs generated by the producer side through HTTP interaction to maintain the contract, so any changes on the producer side would break the contract.
